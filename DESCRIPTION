Description: Implements a gate-based AutoIML workflow (G1-G7) for mlr3 Tasks and Learners.
    Produces task- and data-dependent interpretability artifacts (ALE/ICE, interaction screening,
    calibration and decision utility incl. OVR for multiclass, faithfulness and stability checks,
    multiplicity and subgroup audits) with minimal dependencies.
