Description: Implements a gate-based AutoIML workflow (G0A/G0B, G1-G6, G7A/G7B) for mlr3 Tasks and Learners.
    Produces task- and data-dependent interpretability artifacts (ALE/ICE, interaction screening,
    calibration and decision utility incl. OVR for multiclass, faithfulness and stability checks,
    multiplicity and subgroup audits) with minimal dependencies.
