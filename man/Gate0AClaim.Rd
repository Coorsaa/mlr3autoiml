\title{Gate 0A: Scope Claim & Use (Claim-First)}
\description{
Establishes and validates the \strong{intended interpretive claim(s)} (global / local / decision)
and the \strong{semantics} under which explanations are interpreted.

This gate makes the "meaning" of explanation artifacts explicit \emph{before} producing them.
The framework distinguishes three semantics families:
}
\section{Semantics}{

\describe{
\item{Associational / on-manifold (descriptive)}{Summarize patterns along the empirical
joint distribution (do not interpret as interventions).}
\item{Marginal what-if (model-based, non-causal)}{"What would the model predict if we set X_j = x?",
which may break empirical dependence and requires explicit support / off-manifold diagnostics.}
\item{Causal / recourse (intervention / action)}{Requires explicit causal assumptions and an action-set
(mutable features, constraints, costs). This package does \strong{not} implement causal identification;
requesting causal/recourse semantics triggers a hard stop.}
}

Users can provide a claim specification via \code{ctx$claim} (or \code{config = list(claim = ...)}).
Conservative defaults are filled based on \code{purpose}.
