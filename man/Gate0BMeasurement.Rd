\title{Gate 0B: Measurement / Construct Readiness}
\description{
Screens whether measurement/construct considerations are sufficiently addressed
\strong{before} modeling and explanation.

This gate is deliberately conservative: many psychometric properties (reliability,
invariance/comparability) cannot be inferred from the modeling dataset alone.
Instead, users can provide a minimal measurement specification via \code{ctx$measurement}
(or \code{config = list(measurement = list(...))}).

\section{Automatic Diagnostics}{

\itemize{
\item Summarize missingness rates (feature-level) and flag high missingness
\item Detect whether the task provides subgroup variables (via \code{ctx$sensitive_features})
}
}

\section{User Input Required}{

\itemize{
\item Reliability evidence (e.g., omega/alpha for scale scores, test-retest)
\item Invariance/comparability evidence across relevant groups
\item Whether predictors are composites/scale scores vs. single items vs. latent scores
}
