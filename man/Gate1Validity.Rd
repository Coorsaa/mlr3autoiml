\title{Gate 1: Modeling and Data Validity (Preflight)}
\description{
Establishes predictive adequacy before explanation. This gate:
\itemize{
\item Validates learner configuration (requires probabilistic predictions for classification)
\item Runs honest resampling for performance estimation
\item Compares against a featureless baseline
\item Trains the final model on full data for downstream gates
}

For multiclass tasks with learners lacking native multiclass support,
automatically wraps with one-vs-rest (OVR) if mlr3pipelines is available.
