\title{Gate 2: What is Being Summarized? (Dependence & Interactions)}
\description{
Produces dependence-aware global structure artifacts, focusing on:
\itemize{
\item Feature dependence screening (numeric correlation proxy)
\item Global effect curves (PDP/ICE and ALE)
\item Interaction screening (Friedman-Popescu H-statistic on a sampled grid)
\item Optional regionalization of heterogeneous effects (lightweight GADGET-style)
}
}
\section{Notes}{

PDP/ICE and ALE are intervention-style, model-agnostic summaries; interpret
cautiously under strong feature dependence and outside the data support.
ALE is generally preferred under strong dependence (Apley & Zhu).
PDP/ICE implementation uses an equidistant grid by default, mirroring 'iml'
defaults; ALE uses a quantile grid (also consistent with 'iml').
