\title{Gate 3: Calibration and Decision Utility}
\description{
Implements calibration and decision-utility diagnostics for classification tasks.

For \strong{decision support}, calibration alone is insufficient: users should specify
decision utilities/costs (or a justified threshold policy) and evaluate
downstream consequences (utility curves / DCA).
}
\section{Currently Implemented}{

\describe{
\item{Binary classification}{Calibration intercept/slope, ECE, reliability curve,
decision curve analysis (net benefit), and cost-/utility-sensitive threshold sweep.}
\item{Multiclass classification}{One-vs-rest calibration/utility checks per class
(intercept/slope, ECE, reliability, OVR net benefit) plus overall logloss and
multiclass Brier score.}
\item{Regression}{Basic error metrics (calibration/utility mainly relevant for
probabilistic forecasts).}
