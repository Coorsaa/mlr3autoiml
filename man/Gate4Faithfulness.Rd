\title{Gate 4: Faithfulness (Surrogates, Local Accuracy, Local Interactions)}
\description{
Screens whether the model's behavior is reasonably captured by:
\itemize{
\item Simple global surrogates (linear model R-squared)
\item Additive, case-level attributions (SHAP local accuracy checks)
}

The gate intentionally keeps diagnostics lightweight; it is not a proof of
faithfulness. If strong interactions or heterogeneous effects are present,
prefer region-wise explanations and interaction-aware tools.
}
\section{Modes}{

SHAP mode defaults to conditional (on-manifold) for associational semantics
and marginal for what-if semantics.
