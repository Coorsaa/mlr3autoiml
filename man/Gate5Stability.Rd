\title{Gate 5: Stability and Robustness}
\description{
Implements two complementary stability layers:
\itemize{
\item Performance variability across resampling iterations (from Gate 1)
\item Explanation stability via bootstrap permutation importance on the final model
}

When features are correlated, the gate automatically groups them for joint
permutation to reduce attribution distortion.
