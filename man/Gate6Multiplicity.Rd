\title{Gate 6: Multiplicity and Transport}
\description{
Implements multiplicity (Rashomon effect) and transportability diagnostics.

\strong{Multiplicity:} Evaluates performance across alternative model classes and
applies a conservative Rashomon set selection using the 1-SE rule by default.
When multiple models achieve near-tie performance, computes explanation dispersion
via permutation importance rank correlations.

\strong{Transportability:} Assesses subgroup performance heterogeneity if a Task
\code{group} role is set, providing early warning for distribution shift issues.
