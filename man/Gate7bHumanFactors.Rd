\title{Gate 7B: Human-Factors Evaluation (Decision Support)}
\description{
Explanations can change users' beliefs and decisions in unintended ways.
This gate does not "run" a user study; it flags when human-factors evaluation
is warranted and provides a lightweight checklist.
}
\section{When Triggered}{

The gate triggers a warning for high-stakes or decision-support purposes,
recommending formal human-factors evaluation.
}

\section{Recommended Evaluation Tasks}{

\itemize{
\item Error detection (identify wrong model outputs)
\item Appropriate reliance / deferral
\item Consistency across cases
\item Robustness to misleading explanations (spurious patterns)
}
}
