\description{
Map a set of gate outcomes to an Interpretation Readiness Level (IRL).

IRL is computed \strong{only from achieved evidence} (gate outcomes), consistent with the
paper's definition that levels are cumulative and claims must not exceed the highest level
whose evidence requirements are met.

The \code{purpose} argument is accepted for convenience (e.g., downstream claim-scope text),
but it does \strong{not} cap the achieved IRL.
