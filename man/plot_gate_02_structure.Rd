\title{Gate 2 Plotting Helpers}
\description{
Internal ggplot2-based plotting helpers for Gate 2 (Dependence & Structure).

Design goal: make ALE and PDP+ICE plots look close to the 'iml' package's defaults:
\itemize{
\item ALE: single line + rug
\item PDP+ICE: many ICE lines + one PDP line + rug + legend "Curve"
}

These functions visualize feature effects, interactions, and heterogeneity
diagnostics produced by Gate 2.
