\description{
Internal Shapley/SHAP-style attribution computations via an intervention-style
construction inspired by the 'iml' package's Shapley class.

The implementation supports two modes:
\itemize{
\item \code{"marginal"} (interventional): breaks feature dependence by design and
answers a model-based "what-if" question (holding other features to
background draws). This matches the classic SHAP formulation.
\item \code{"conditional"}: aims to respect empirical dependence by sampling
background rows conditional on the already-fixed feature coalition.
This approximates an on-manifold / associational question using a
lightweight kNN conditional sampler.
